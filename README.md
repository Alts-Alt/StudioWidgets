<h1 align="center">Studio Widgets</h1>

<div align="center">
	A set of GUI elements to use in Roblox Plugins hosted in PluginGUIs. Widgets have a standard "Studio" look & feel.
</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

## Usage
With PluginGuis, your RobloxPlugins can create GUIs hosted in dockable widgets (as opposed to being hosted in 3d viewport).

We encourage plugin developers to use this library so that your GUIs have a standardized look & feel: colors, spacing, layout, etc.

We will keep these libraries up to date as Studio look & feel changes (e.g. automatic support for Dark Theme, when that happens).
